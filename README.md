# WizNET-W5500-Driver
This repository contains a compact, platform independent and  easy to integrate driver for WizNet W5500 IC and Ethernet Shield.
## Introduction
This driver is designed as an open-source project so feel free to suggest changes or provide feedback. The main goal was to create a driver which everyone can easily integrate and use.
## Use
This is a platform independent driver which means you can use it with nearly all type of microcontrollers. To reach this functionality we've separated the SPI communication as an independent transfer layer so you can implement the communication without a deep understanding of the driver.
### How to integrate the driver
